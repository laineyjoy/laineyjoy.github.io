        <h2>About Lainey</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Lainey Meiri is a student of communication and a lover of words. She works at the University of Miami School of Law helping students access public interest opportunities as well as with the Hillel Foundation’s Campus Entrepreneurs Initiative building educational relationships with Jewish students on campus. After graduation, Lainey hopes to spend a few years in Israel to work on a project that is very near to her heart and then return to the United States for law school. An avid reader, she has particular passions for poetry and children’s literature. Although she loves living in Miami, Lainey considers herself a resident of the world and hopes she will have plenty of time to travel and to explore other cultures throughout her life.</p>
